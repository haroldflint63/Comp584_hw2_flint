## GitHub Pages

This repository is configured to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically when changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Viewing the Site

Once GitHub Pages is enabled in the repository settings, the site will be available at:
- Main page: `https://haroldflint63.github.io/Comp584_hw2_flint/`
- Email campaign: `https://haroldflint63.github.io/Comp584_hw2_flint/ai-chip-email-campaign.html`

### Setup

The deployment is automated using GitHub Actions. The workflow file (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) handles:
1. Building the site
2. Uploading artifacts
3. Deploying to GitHub Pages

To enable GitHub Pages, go to repository Settings → Pages → Source and select "GitHub Actions" as the source.
